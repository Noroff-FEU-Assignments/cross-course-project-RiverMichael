    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      To start with, I would explain the different security threats such as
      cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injections, and cross-site request forgery
      (XSRF). I would then advise including everyone that is working on the
      project in the security practices. This will make everyone aware of the
      security threats and understand the potential vulnerabilities.<br /><br />Then
      I would advise my client to ensure their web server uses HTTPS instead of
      HTTP. This means that the communication between the server and client is
      encrypted and could make information such as login credentials harder to
      access for hackers. Also, make sure that automatic user timeout is
      implemented. This makes sure that important user credentials do not stay
      in the browser. I would also suggest using effective password management
      such as strong passwords and a two-factor authentication system.<br /><br />If
      they are using a third-party application, I would tell them to make sure
      that it is a trusted and tested application.<br /><br />Ensure that all
      user-originating data is sanitized before it is displayed in the browser,
      used in SQL queries, or passed to an operating or file system, and only
      allow the storage and display of the data that is really needed. An
      example of this is to only show the last 4 digits of a credit card.<br /><br />Finally,
      make sure that security testing is being done from the start of the
      project and not only when the website is finished. This should include
      CI/CD, vulnerability scanning and also security exercises.
